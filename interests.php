       <p>When I am not in the classroom, I have several other hobbies that I enjoy doing. I like to go on hikes and try to do it at least three times a week, but it can be challenging to schedule around my academic responsabilites. Another thing I enjoy doing with my time is spending time with my friends and family. Being around my community allows me to recharge and take a break.</p>
